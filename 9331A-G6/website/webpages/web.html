           <h1> Overview of the World Wide Web</h1>
            <p class="textcontent1">
                World Wide Web also known as WWW or triple W is a technology invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee during year 1989. It is a collection of Web Resources and Applications which allow the clients to access the internet through a Web Browser. The server hosts web resources for clients to access it.
            </p>
            <p class="textcontent1">
                The client can access the World Wide Web by using a web browser and after opening a browser, the client will type a URL Address. Web Browsers are software applications that the client uses to retrieve resources from a specific URL. Uniform Resource Locator is a unique identifier for a specific resource.
                <br><br>
                Here is an example of URL:
                <br><br>
                <img id="urlsample" src="../pictures/urlsample.png" alt="URL sample">
                <br>
           </p>
            
            <p class="textcontent1">
            The example URL above was divided into 3 different parts namely, scheme, host and path. <b>Scheme</b> is the one which identifies the protocol that was to access the resources in the internet. It can be http:// or https:// depending on the link. Next is the <b>host</b> which identifies the host that holds the resource. It can be a name that represents an address  that is hosted by the server. The third one is the <b>path</b> which specifies the specific location of the resource. In the example, it is only the file that was included but it can also have different parent folders. 
            </p>
