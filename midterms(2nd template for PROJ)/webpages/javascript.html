			<p class="textcontent1">
                Javascript is a dynamic and purely object-oriented programming language primarily used for the development of a website.
                Its purpose is to make the website interactive and at the same time provide a simple and yet responsive webpage making it 
                more user-friendly. Today, all of the web browsers support Javascript and all of the Javascript engines are based on the
                ECMA script specification.

					<ul>
					   <li><b>&lt; Script ></b> - It is an element in Javascript which contains the scripting statements or external script. It is also
                    used to define the client-side script. It has two attributes namely <b>async and defer</b> that gives the programmer
                        more control for the flow of the external files.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li><b>Async</b> - it is an attribute used so that the program can execute aynschronously. </li>
                        <li>It will not block the execution of the page if the script is waiting for something. </li>

                        <li><b>Defer</b> - it is an attribute that gives the browser a signal to execute the script once the parsing of the HTML is complete</li>

                    <ul>
                    <li><b>&lt; Noscript ></b> - It is an alternative script that will be executed once the browser doesn't support Javascript.
                           <li>It makes sure that it will inform the user that the browser doesn't support javascript.</li>
